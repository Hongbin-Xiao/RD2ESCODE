# RD2ESCODE: Automated Transformation of Requirements Documents into Embedded System Code

## 📝 Overview

RD2ESCODE is an innovative framework designed to automatically transform embedded system requirements documents into executable code. This project addresses the time-consuming and error-prone nature of requirements validation in embedded system development by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to rapidly generate verifiable embedded code from requirements documentation.

## 📊 Dataset
We created a dataset comprising 15 simulated implementations of embedded systems to evaluate our method. The dataset includes:

- 15 requirements documents for embedded systems ranging from simple to complex
- Reference code in three different programming styles
- Executable simulation systems implemented in Proteus 8 Professional
